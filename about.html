        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="about-me">I have had a passion for coding since taking my first intro
            to programming class using BASIC during my freshman year in High School.
            My happiest day was when I landed my first coding job after college graduation.</p>
        <p class="about-me">After 20+ years of being an ERP Software Developer using PeopleSoft and SQL,
            the company that employed me at the time (Accenture) announced PSoft was an old/outdated
            technology and encouraged my department to switch to a cloud-based ERP system. As a result,
            I pivoted to Workday, which is a cloud-based ERP system, but not customizable, so my job was
            configuring integrations, which was not as much fun for me as software development.</p>
        <p class="about-me">So I joined a program that paid me to learn and get certified in Salesforce.
            I obtained certifications in Administration and Platform Development, and my corhort 
            and I were supposed to be placed in at Cognizant for two years, but they backed out.
            Finding a SF developer job with only the certifications and no actually SF work experience
            turned out to be impossible. Even the Junior SF Developer positions required five years of
            SF experience (none of my corhort were able to land a SF developer job).</p>
        <p class="about-me">This turned out to a blessing in disguise because now I have to opportunity
            to work with Python. I have worked with many programming languages over the years but Python
            is by far my favorite. I also now have to chance to learn a lot of new technologies,
            which I finding fascinating. I haven't had this much fun coding since my college days.
            I am really looking forward to working as a full stack or back end developer.</p><br>
