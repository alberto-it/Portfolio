        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="about-me">I have had a passion for coding since taking my first introduction
            to programming class (BASIC) during my freshman year in High School.
            My happiest day was when I landed my first coding job after college graduation.</p>
        <p class="about-me">After 20+ years of ERP Software Development with PeopleSoft and SQL,
            the company that I worked for at the time (Accenture) told me that PeopleSoft was
            old/outdated and encouraged me to switch to a cloud-based ERP system.
            As a result, I pivoted to Workday, which is a <b>non</b>-customizable ERP system,
            but configuring integrations was not as much fun for me as software development.</p>
        <p class="about-me">I got certified as a Salesforce Platform Developer but had trouble
            finding a Salesforce Developer position after getting my certification
            (even the Junior Developer position seem to require over five years of Salesforce experience)</p>
        <p class="about-me">This is a blessing in disguise because now I have to opportunity
            to work with Python, which is by far my favorite programming lauguage.
            I have taken a number of online Python courses over the years I am really looking
            forward to working with it.
